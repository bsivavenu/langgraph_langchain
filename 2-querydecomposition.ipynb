    "Query decomposition is the process of taking a complex, multi-part question and breaking it into simpler, atomic sub-questions that can each be retrieved and answered individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Why Use Query Decomposition?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex queries often involve multiple concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs or retrievers may miss parts of the original question\n",
    "\n",
    "- It enables multi-hop reasoning (answering in steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows parallelism (especially in multi-agent frameworks)"

      "✅ Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Sub-question 1: What memory models and storage options does LangChain offer for agents (e.g., specific memory primitives, how they store, retrieve, and summarize context)?\n",
      "A: - The provided context notes that LangChain agents use a planner-executor model with “context-aware memory use across steps.”\n",
      "- It does not specify any memory models, memory primitives, storage options, or how to store, retrieve, or summarize context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: There is a mention of memory capability, but no concrete details about memory primitives or storage/retrieval/summarization mechanisms in the given text. If you can share more detailed docs or specify the LangChain version, I can give a precise answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Sub-question 2: How do LangChain agents handle reasoning, planning, and tool use (e.g., ReAct-style loops), and where does memory participate in that flow?\n",
      "A: - Core pattern: LangChain agents use a planner-executor loop. The planner decides a sequence of tool invocations (actions) to achieve the goal, and the executor carries out those tools and returns observations. This loop can incorporate dynamic decision-making, branching logic, and memory across steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reasoning and planning (ReAct-style): The agent performs planning that combines reasoning about the goal with deciding which tool to invoke next. In a ReAct-like loop, the agent repeatedly alternates: plan (reason about the next action or subgoal), execute (call the chosen tool), observe the result, then plan again based on what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tool use: Tools are invoked according to the current plan by the executor. Each tool call yields an observation or result that informs the next planning step.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Memory and where it participates: Memory is used across steps to maintain context—previous observations, tool results, intermediate facts, and the overall state of the task. This context-aware memory informs future planning decisions, enabling dynamic branching, avoiding repetition, and enabling continuity across the reasoning-execution cycles. In short, memory feeds the planner with history and context, and is updated by the executor with every tool result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Sub-question 3: What is CrewAI’s approach to memory and agent architecture (memory types, persistence/retrieval, and how agents reason and act)?\n",
      "A: - The provided context does not specify CrewAI’s memory types, persistence/retrieval mechanisms, or the internal reasoning/acting model.\n",
      "- What is described:\n",
      "  - Each agent has a defined purpose, a goal, and a set of tools.\n",
      "  - Agents operate semi-independently within a collaborative framework and follow structured workflows.\n",
      "  - Roles include examples like researcher, planner, and executor, all contributing to the crew’s objective.\n",
      "- Inference (not stated explicitly in the text):\n",
      "  - The architecture is a role-based, workflow-driven multi-agent system designed for coordination and task division.\n",
      "  - Reasoning and action likely emerge from role-specific responsibilities (e.g., planners reason about plans, researchers gather information, executors carry out tasks with tools) within the overall workflow, aided by collaboration with other crew members.\n",
      "- If you want a concrete design outline (memory, persistence, reasoning) I can propose one, but the current material does not prescribe specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Sub-question 4: What are the key architectural and capability differences between LangChain and CrewAI regarding memory handling and agent design, including typical use cases and trade-offs?\n",
      "A: Here are the key architectural and capability differences, with typical use cases and trade-offs, focused on memory handling and agent design as described in the provided context.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Architectural focus\n",
      "  - LangChain\n",
      "    - Agent design: planner-executor model. The agent plans a sequence of tool invocations to reach a goal, with support for dynamic decision-making, branching, and context-aware memory across steps.\n",
      "    - Memory role: memory is a built-in capability used to inform planning and decisions as the plan unfolds.\n",
      "  - CrewAI\n",
      "    - Agent design: role-based collaboration layer. CrewAI coordinates multiple agents, each with defined roles, to collaborate toward a shared objective.\n",
      "    - Memory role: not described in the provided context. The emphasis is on coordinating roles; memory handling is not explicitly highlighted as a core feature (at least in the given text).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Memory handling\n",
      "  - LangChain\n",
      "    - Explicit emphasis on context-aware memory across steps, enabling the planner to reuse context and guide subsequent tool calls.\n",
      "  - CrewAI\n",
      "    - Memory model is not specified in the provided context. The focus is on collaboration among role-specific agents, rather than on a centralized memory mechanism for planning steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Typical use cases\n",
      "  - LangChain\n",
      "    - Tasks that require structured, multi-step reasoning and sequential tool usage.\n",
      "    - Scenarios with memory across steps to maintain context (e.g., data gathering, API orchestration, complex reasoning chains).\n",
      "  - CrewAI\n",
      "    - Multi-agent tasks requiring diverse perspectives and governance from different roles.\n",
      "    - Collaborative workflows where accountability and role-specific input are important (e.g., reviews, design-by-committee, multi-stakeholder decision making).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trade-offs\n",
      "  - LangChain\n",
      "    - Strengths: robust automatic planning of tool invocations, deep memory for context, dynamic branching, and self-contained reasoning within a single (planner-based) agent.\n",
      "    - Trade-offs: can be complex to implement and maintain; planning logic may become intricate with many branches; primarily suited to single-agent or tightly coupled planning scenarios.\n",
      "  - CrewAI\n",
      "    - Strengths: strong support for distributed collaboration across defined roles, which can improve reliability, checks, and coverage of expertise.\n",
      "    - Trade-offs: potential coordination overhead and slower throughput due to multi-agent collaboration; memory/continuity mechanisms are not described and may depend on how the ensemble is composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hybrid integration (from the provided context)\n",
      "  - The systems can be combined: LangChain handles retrieval and tool wrapping, while CrewAI handles role-based collaboration. This allows building a hybrid workflow where a planner-oriented, memory-capable LangChain component works alongside a role-coordinating CrewAI component.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, LangChain centers on planning and memory-rich, multi-step tool usage within (often) a single-agent framework, while CrewAI centers on coordinating multiple role-based agents. LangChain’s memory is explicit and core to its design; CrewAI’s memory model isn’t specified in the context, with the emphasis on collaborative governance and orchestration instead. When used together, you get a hybrid that leverages LangChain’s retrieval/tooling and CrewAI’s collaborative structure.\n"
